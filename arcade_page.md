This project was created about 3 month after I started learning c++ through [internet resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwuIEMUFUnQ&list=PLqCJpWy5FohcehaXlCIt8sVBHBFFRVWsx&index=1).<br/>
I consider it legacy by now as there are a ton of bad design decisions in the code that I wouldn't repeat today. But until my Engine is finished it stays as my biggest __finished__ project.
