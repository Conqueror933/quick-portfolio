- Syntax + Basics of C++ 00/11/14/17/20
- everything std::
- Unions
- Pointer magic
- Templates
- Run & Compile -time polymorphism
- Design Patterns
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Debugging
- Template Debugging
- Tests & Performance
- Synchronous & Asynchronous program-flow
- Networking
- User Interface Design
- 2D & 3D Graphics (programming)
- Physics
- AI
- Logistics (factorio)

In-depth: <- make it its own page/or a "spoiler" type deal
- Syntax + Basics of C++ - only included for completions sake
- everything std:: - STL and Standard library, containers, algorithms, etc.
- Unions - and other types of low level memory management
- Pointer magic - Pointer arithmetics, Ownership-management with pointers
- Templates - from using them to making them, see here(link engine vector) for an example
- Run & Compile -time polymorphism - everything from dynamic dispatch, virtual function tables to template meta programming
- Design Patterns - from Singleton and Update Patterns to Data locality and XXX
- Data Structures - everything about O(n) and when to ignore it
- Algorithms - yes
- Debugging - search and fix
- Template Debugging - able to read and understand page-long template error messages
- Tests - from unit tests to finding performance bottlenecks, never assume anything, test it, try it, break it, fix it.
- Synchronous & Asynchronous program-flow - all things multithreading, advantages, disadvantages and most of all pitfalls
- Networking - while not used in practice yet, I have theoretical knowledge and know some pitfalls
- User Interface - the Do's and Dont's of what makes and breaks a UI

...and the projects to prove it:

Soft-Skills:
- Leadership ability
- Teamplayer & Lone wolf alike
	- I can work in and with a team, assign roles or just fulfill mine, but I can also do whatever is needed on my own
- Goal-oriented way of working
- Always calm and collected
- Extremly fast and thorough learner
- Phenomenal analyzing skills

## [Arcade](/pages/arcade_page)
My biggest completed project so far.<br/>

## [Quiz](/pages/quiz_page)
Simple quiz that reads it's questions and answers from a .txt<br/>
Also supports counting of right and wrong answers and will prompt questions at weighted random, considering right/wrong ratios.<br/>

## [Engine](/pages/engine_page)
The project I am currently working on.<br/>
While it already reached a 'working' state big changes and refacturing leave it non-functioning at the moment,<br/>
however here's a sneakpeak at some of the most interesting pieces.<br/>
(code and explanation only)<br/>
