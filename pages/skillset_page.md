In-depth: <- make it its own page/or a "spoiler" type deal
- Syntax + Basics of C++ - only included for completions sake
- everything std:: - STL and Standard library, containers, algorithms, etc.
- Unions - and other types of low level memory management
- Pointer magic - Pointer arithmetics, Ownership-management with pointers
- Templates - from using them to making them, see here(link engine vector) for an example
- Run & Compile -time polymorphism - everything from dynamic dispatch, virtual function tables to template meta programming
- Design Patterns - from Singleton and Update Patterns to Data locality and XXX
- Data Structures - everything about O(n) and when to ignore it
- Algorithms - yes
- Debugging - search and fix
- Template Debugging - able to read and understand page-long template error messages
- Tests - from unit tests to finding performance bottlenecks, never assume anything, test it, try it, break it, fix it.
- Synchronous & Asynchronous program-flow - all things multithreading, advantages, disadvantages and most of all pitfalls
- Networking - while not used in practice yet, I have theoretical knowledge and know some pitfalls
- User Interface - the Do's and Dont's of what makes and breaks a UI

...and the projects to prove it:
