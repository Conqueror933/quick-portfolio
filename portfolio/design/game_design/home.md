How to make a game:
Choose:
target audience -> theme, genre -> business model

Do research:
search for similar game -> play similar game -> find problems and fun aspects of similar game -> fix flaws/expand good elements

Create:
gameplay identity for races/empires/character (tank, heal, dps, rush, turtle,...) -> think of main gameplay loop -> explore effects and interactions between identities -> ensure that (in theory) interactions are fun -> create prototype -> test prototype -> find potential problems in design (not balance!) -> fix potential design problems, preferably with good ingame mechanics (instead of number hardcaps) -> try balancing the game -> playtest again -> keep testing and changing numbers until 90% balance is achieved -> add additional features -> release game to a large audience -> tweak balance -> profit
